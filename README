Backend to BrowserQuest (http://browserquest.mozilla.org/) in Erlang/OTP.
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sedrik/bqs.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sedrik/bqs)

We make use of Cowboy websocket handlers for communication with
the BrowserQuest client. No modifications were done to the BrowserQuest Client
except for ip configuration.
The goal is to build a more scalable backend for websocket-based games.

Features:
    * Player login and movement works. Map collision detection and
      player start position generation.
    * Basic monster spawning and fighting.
    * Different architecture compared to original nodeJS backend; 
      we hope to add more scalability features later on. The architecture 
      is event-based and players, monsters and items are mapped as Erlang 
      processes.

Future:
    * Support item drops and static NPCs.
    * Proper supervisor tree.

Installation:
Backend:

1. git clone git@github.com:Spawnfest2012/win.git
2. cd win
2. ./rebar get-deps
3. ./rebar compile
4. ./init.sh
5. Launch a new terminal
6. Start Client (see below)

Client:

1. git clone git@github.com:Gustav-Simonsson/BrowserQuest.git
2. Launch backend.
3. Point browser to BrowserQuest/client/index.html
4. If you cannot connect, check the config files in BrowserQuest/client/config
   for host/port settings. Default port in backend is set to 8000 but can be 
   changed in the app.src
